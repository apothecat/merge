# Merge

A simple dating application using Spring Boot. 

## Additional files

The initial implementation of this project was to satisfy the requirements of the introductory software engineering modules for my current university course. I was also required to write two reports for these modules, which I have included in this repo for context: 

- intro-to-software-engineering-assignment.pdf 
- software-testing-and-maintenence-assignment.pdf

A short demo of the application in action is also provided:

## Assignment Brief

*You are a project manager at MMU Corp, a medium-sized software service company. An external client has asked you to
design and build a dating website aimed at software developers.  You are assigned a team of 3 developers, a tester, and a business analyst. You are part way through develpment and upper management have asked for a detailed progress report. Your task is to write a report discussing the requirements gathering, design and implementation of the project.*

## Builing and Running the Source Code

The  'merge' directory is a Maven project packaged as an executable JAR. It should therefore contain all of the resources associated with the project.  
 
The process of building and running the source code may depend on the IDE. In IntelliJ: 

- Go to File-->New-->Project from Existing Sources. 
- Import as a Maven project.
- Navigate to the 'merge' directory.
- In the project file structure, navigate to the main class 'MergeApplication'.
- Right click and select 'Run'. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the site.
